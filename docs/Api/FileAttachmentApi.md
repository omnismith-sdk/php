## `deleteFileAttachment()`

```php
deleteFileAttachment($id, $xOmnismithProjectId)
```

Delete a file attachment

Permanently deletes a file attachment and its stored content from disk. If the file is referenced by entity attribute values (file or image data type), those references will become stale. Returns 204 on success.

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure Bearer (JWT) authorization: bearerAuth
$config = Omnismith\Sdk\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');


$apiInstance = new Omnismith\Sdk\Api\FileAttachmentApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$id = 018b2f1b-8c1a-75b3-8000-7f0000010000; // string | File attachment UUID to delete
$xOmnismithProjectId = 018b2f1b-7c3a-7d2e-8f1a-2b3c4d5e6f7d; // string | The project this call acts on. A credential proves identity and grants a set of projects; it never selects one, so every tenant-scoped call names its target here. The value must be one of the projects in the credential's `projects` claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored. A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code `stale_project_grant`; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying. Omitting the header is not an error: the caller is simply acting with no project selected, and a tenant-scoped operation then answers 409 `no_project_selected`. Two clients holding the same credential may send different values at the same time.

try {
    $apiInstance->deleteFileAttachment($id, $xOmnismithProjectId);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling FileAttachmentApi->deleteFileAttachment: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
```

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description  | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **id** | **string**| File attachment UUID to delete | |
| **xOmnismithProjectId** | **string**| The project this call acts on. A credential proves identity and grants a set of projects; it never selects one, so every tenant-scoped call names its target here. The value must be one of the projects in the credential&#39;s &#x60;projects&#x60; claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored. A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code &#x60;stale_project_grant&#x60;; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying.

## `getFileAttachmentMetadata()`

```php

Returns metadata for a file attachment (original filename, MIME type, file size in bytes, upload timestamp, context) without streaming the binary content. Use this to inspect file properties before deciding whether to download.

<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');

## `getFileAttachmentThumbnail()`

```php
getFileAttachmentThumbnail($id, $xOmnismithProjectId, $width, $height)

Get image thumbnail

Generates and returns a resized thumbnail for image-type file attachments (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF). Optional `width` and `height` query parameters control output dimensions (range 50–1000px, default 200×200). Returns 400 if the file is not an image type. The thumbnail is returned as JPEG binary.

## `uploadFileAttachment()`

```php
uploadFileAttachment($file, $xOmnismithProjectId, $id, $context, $ttlHours): \Omnismith\Sdk\Model\FileAttachmentResponse
```

Upload a file attachment

Uploads a file as a multipart/form-data request. Supported MIME types include images (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, SVG), documents (PDF), spreadsheets (CSV, XLSX), and structured data (JSON, YAML). An optional pre-generated UUIDv7 `id` can be supplied; otherwise the server generates one. The `context` field controls storage lifecycle: \"entity\" files are permanent, \"chat\" files are temporary with configurable `ttl_hours` (default 48h). Returns the file metadata including the assigned ID for use in entity attribute values.

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure Bearer (JWT) authorization: bearerAuth
$config = Omnismith\Sdk\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');

    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$file = '/path/to/file.txt'; // \SplFileObject
