| Method | HTTP request | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [**listPushDevices()**](AutomationPushDevicesApi.md#listPushDevices) | **GET** /automation/push-devices | List registered push devices |
| [**registerPushDevice()**](AutomationPushDevicesApi.md#registerPushDevice) | **POST** /automation/push-devices | Register a mobile push notification device |

## `listPushDevices()`

```php
listPushDevices($xOmnismithProjectId): \Omnismith\Sdk\Model\ListPushDevices200Response
```

List registered push devices

Retrieves all Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) mobile push devices registered under the authenticated user account for receiving automated push alerts. Device registration tokens are masked in the output for security.

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure Bearer (JWT) authorization: bearerAuth
$config = Omnismith\Sdk\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');


$apiInstance = new Omnismith\Sdk\Api\AutomationPushDevicesApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$xOmnismithProjectId = 018b2f1b-7c3a-7d2e-8f1a-2b3c4d5e6f7d; // string | The project this call acts on. A credential proves identity and grants a set of projects; it never selects one, so every tenant-scoped call names its target here. The value must be one of the projects in the credential's `projects` claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored. A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code `stale_project_grant`; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying. Omitting the header is not an error: the caller is simply acting with no project selected, and a tenant-scoped operation then answers 409 `no_project_selected`. Two clients holding the same credential may send different values at the same time.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->listPushDevices($xOmnismithProjectId);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling AutomationPushDevicesApi->listPushDevices: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
```

## `registerPushDevice()`

```php
registerPushDevice($registerPushDeviceRequest, $xOmnismithProjectId): \Omnismith\Sdk\Model\RegisterPushDevice201Response

Register a mobile push notification device

Registers an FCM device token under the authenticated user account to receive real-time push notifications from automation action triggers. If the token is already registered, its device name and activity timestamp are updated.

## `unregisterPushDevice()`
