## `createDashboard()`

```php
createDashboard($createDashboardRequest, $xOmnismithProjectId): \Omnismith\Sdk\Model\CreateDashboard201Response
```

Create a new dashboard

Creates a new analytics and telemetry dashboard canvas for organizing metric KPIs, charts, gauges, and entity tables within a customizable grid layout.

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure Bearer (JWT) authorization: bearerAuth
$config = Omnismith\Sdk\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');


$apiInstance = new Omnismith\Sdk\Api\DashboardsApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$createDashboardRequest = new \Omnismith\Sdk\Model\CreateDashboardRequest(); // \Omnismith\Sdk\Model\CreateDashboardRequest | Dashboard creation payload
$xOmnismithProjectId = 018b2f1b-7c3a-7d2e-8f1a-2b3c4d5e6f7d; // string | The project this call acts on. A credential proves identity and grants a set of projects; it never selects one, so every tenant-scoped call names its target here. The value must be one of the projects in the credential's `projects` claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored. A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code `stale_project_grant`; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying. Omitting the header is not an error: the caller is simply acting with no project selected, and a tenant-scoped operation then answers 409 `no_project_selected`. Two clients holding the same credential may send different values at the same time.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->createDashboard($createDashboardRequest, $xOmnismithProjectId);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling DashboardsApi->createDashboard: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
```
