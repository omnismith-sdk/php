## `createAutomation()`

```php
createAutomation($createAutomationRequest, $xOmnismithProjectId): \Omnismith\Sdk\Model\CreateAutomation201Response
```

Create an automation rule

Creates a new event-driven automation rule within the current project. Configures event trigger criteria (such as `on_entity_created`, `on_entity_updated`, or `on_attribute_changed`), multi-condition filters evaluating attribute values (using operators `eq`, `neq`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `contains`, `not_contains`, `is_empty`, `is_not_empty` across current value or delta modes), automated action targets (`telegram`, `webhook`, `push`), and an optional cooldown window in seconds to throttle repeated firings for the same entity.

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure Bearer (JWT) authorization: bearerAuth
$config = Omnismith\Sdk\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');


$apiInstance = new Omnismith\Sdk\Api\AutomationAutomationsApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$createAutomationRequest = new \Omnismith\Sdk\Model\CreateAutomationRequest(); // \Omnismith\Sdk\Model\CreateAutomationRequest
$xOmnismithProjectId = 018b2f1b-7c3a-7d2e-8f1a-2b3c4d5e6f7d; // string | The project this call acts on. A credential proves identity and grants a set of projects; it never selects one, so every tenant-scoped call names its target here. The value must be one of the projects in the credential's `projects` claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored. A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code `stale_project_grant`; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying. Omitting the header is not an error: the caller is simply acting with no project selected, and a tenant-scoped operation then answers 409 `no_project_selected`. Two clients holding the same credential may send different values at the same time.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->createAutomation($createAutomationRequest, $xOmnismithProjectId);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling AutomationAutomationsApi->createAutomation: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
```

## `listAutomations()`

```php
listAutomations($xOmnismithProjectId, $templateId, $isEnabled): \Omnismith\Sdk\Model\AutomationResponse[]
```

List project automations

Retrieves all automation rules configured within the current project context. Automations define event-driven workflows triggered by entity lifecycle events (such as entity creation, attribute updates, or metric threshold changes), evaluated against multi-attribute conditions, and dispatched to configured action channels (Telegram, webhooks, mobile push). Results can be filtered by entity template or active status.

A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code &#x60;stale_project_grant&#x60;; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying. Omitting the header is not an error: the caller is simply acting with no project selected, and a tenant-scoped operation then answers 409 &#x60;no_project_selected&#x60;. Two clients holding the same credential may send different values at the same time. | [optional] |
